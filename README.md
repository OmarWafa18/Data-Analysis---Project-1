The Impact of Question Wording on Survey

📊 Overview
This project explores how the wording of questions can influence survey responses. By analyzing real survey data and applying statistical and visual analysis through Python, we investigate whether variations in phrasing affect the outcome and perception of responses.

The analysis highlights the subtle but significant role of language in survey design, emphasizing the importance of neutrality and clarity in data collection.

🧠 Objectives
-Assess how small changes in question wording affect survey responses.
-Visualize the distribution of answers across different question variants.
-Provide statistical summaries to support findings.
-Recommend best practices for unbiased survey design.
